# Text Detection and Recognition in Complex Images

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300.png?text=Text+Detection+Project)

## Overview
This project, titled **Text Detection, Text Matching, and Image Matching within GUI Application Screen Images (DIMG)**, focuses on extracting and recognizing text from cluttered, shaded, textured, and low-contrast backgrounds. Conducted at IIT Kharagpur under the supervision of Dr. Rajiv Ranjan Sahay, the project ran from August 20, 2015, to August 19, 2018, sponsored by Altai Engineering India Pvt. Ltd.

The primary goal was to develop a standalone application capable of identifying and reading text in complex images, addressing challenges such as varied fonts, colors, sizes, and orientations. The project successfully delivered a robust solution using both hand-crafted and deep learning-based methods.

- Extract text from complex backgrounds with variations in color, size, font, and orientation.
- Develop a standalone application for text detection and recognition.
- Explore hand-crafted and deep learning-based methods to address text detection challenges.
- Extend the work to related computer vision tasks, such as logo recognition by suppressing text in images.

- **Dataset**: Chars74K (74,000+ character images)

---

## Methodology

### MSER-Based Text Detection
Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) were used to detect stable connected components in images. MSER is effective due to its ability to handle high-contrast text regions efficiently.

- **Implementation**: 
  - MATLAB: Visualized MSER regions with filtering based on geometric properties.
  - OpenCV: Detected text regions in cropped images, though computationally intensive.
- **Key Insight**: MSER performs well for full-text detection in still frames but struggles with high computational cost on large images.

### Stroke Width Transform (SWT)
SWT detects text based on consistent stroke widths, identifying pixels with similar stroke characteristics.

- **Implementations**:
  - **OpenCV + Boost**: Stored stroke width components as edge vectors.
  - **MATLAB + CPP MEX**: Preprocessed images in MATLAB and computed SWT using C++ MEX files.
  - **Python + OpenCV**: Detected dark and light text separately, with fine-tuned parameters to reduce false positives.
- **Challenges**: High-dimensional images caused infinite loops, requiring image cropping.

### Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
OCR was used to recognize detected text, implemented in MATLAB and ASP .NET. It faced challenges with full images, performing better on cropped patches.

### Machine Learning Techniques
Several machine learning approaches were explored:
- **ADABOOST**: Ensemble of weak classifiers, less effective for text detection compared to faces or fences.
- **SVM**: Used color correlograms and histograms as features, with a high loss percentage (66%).
- **LIBSVM**: Improved SVM performance using RBF kernel, tested on 83 text and 83 non-text images.
- **Lukas Neumann Code**: State-of-the-art C++ and OpenCV implementation, though complex due to external library dependencies.
- **CNN-SVM**: Combined CNN feature extraction with SVM classification, achieving higher accuracy than standalone SVM or LIBSVM.
  - **Dataset**: 406 images (203 text, 203 icons).
  - **Accuracy**: Improved performance on resized images (see Table 2 in the report).

---

## Achievements
- Developed and delivered a standalone text detection application.
- Successfully explored hand-crafted (MSER, SWT) and deep learning (CNN-SVM) methods.
- Extended text detection to logo recognition by suppressing text in images.
- Published a paper at ICVGIP 2016: *A Text Recognition Augmented Deep Learning Approach for Logo Identification*.
- Trained one Research Consultant.

   mex swt_mex.cpp
   ```

---

## Usage
1. **Run MATLAB Implementation**:
   ```matlab
   run('mser_text_detection.m')
   ```

2. **Run Python + OpenCV Implementation**:
   ```bash
   python text_detection.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   ```

3. **Run CNN-SVM Model**:
   - Ensure pre-trained models are placed in the `models/` directory.
   ```bash
   python cnn_svm_detector.py --image path/to/image.jpg --model models/cnn_svm.xml
   ```

---

## Dataset
The project used the **Chars74K dataset**, containing:
- 7,705 characters from natural images.
- 3,410 hand-drawn characters.
- 62,992 synthesized characters from computer fonts.
- Total: 74,000+ images across 64 classes (0-9, A-Z, a-z).

**Preprocessing**: 95% of images were tightly fitted into rectangular contours, with 5% excluded due to poor outline fitting.

---

## Results
- **MSER**: Effective for high-contrast text but slow on large images.
- **SWT**: Detected text based on stroke width but required parameter tuning to reduce false positives.
- **CNN-SVM**: Achieved the highest accuracy, especially on resized images.
- **OCR**: Worked better on cropped patches than full images.
- **LIBSVM**: Improved over standard SVM with a loss percentage of 66%.

**Visual Results**:
- MSER regions visualized with jet colormap (Figures 3, 4).
- SWT components displayed as edge vectors (Figures 9, 10).
- CNN-SVM results improved false detections from Lukas Neumann code (Figure 41).

---

## Future Work
- Optimize computational efficiency for large-scale image processing.
- Enhance OCR performance on full images.
- Explore additional deep learning architectures for improved text detection.
- Extend the application to real-time text detection in video streams.
